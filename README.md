This is my first project using Node.js, Express, and React.
It's basically a CRUD system for books.

# ISSUES <br />
. When an insert is made there's a 'PROTOCOL_ENQUEUE_HANDSHAKE_TWICE' error and the server stop running, but the insert is actually made. The console got ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.


# RUN THE PROJECT <br />
biblioteca/client - npm run dev
